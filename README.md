AnimationDemonstration
======================

Simple project demonstrating animating a view to answer a StackOverflow question. 

The views are created in the Storyboard. The animation is triggered when you press the "Move View" button via standard target-action (With Storyboards, just control-drag from the button to the view controller code to create this connection).
